# PUF-based-SGC-for-LAN-with-dynamic-group-membership
This repository contains the official release of (1) the ProVerif scripts and verification results; (2) the demonstration video of a 16-node prototype LAN, for "A Lightweight PUF-based Secure Group Communication Scheme for Low Altitude Network With Dynamic Group Membership", accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing in 2025. 

This paper introduced a novel PUF-based lightweight secure group communication protocol. The proposed protocol utilizes a combination of the device’s PUF and the one-time pad (OTP) to eliminate secure key storage at both group verifier and prover nodes, and achieves perfect forward secrecy (PFS) by eliminating dependence on static long-term secrets. The proposed protocol also supports efficient group key renewal by using a full binary tree as a secret vault for sharing and updating distributed secrets with Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Meantime, this data structure also reduces the computation and communication complexity  for key renewal to $O(\log_2N)$ at the cluster head and $O(1)$ at the sensor nodes. A comparative analysis shows that the proposed protocol surpasses related protocols in terms of security features and overheads in computation, communication as well as secret storage requirements. The proposed protocol was also validated by formal security analyse and a physical LAN implementation using Ultra96-V2 boards as cluster nodes.
